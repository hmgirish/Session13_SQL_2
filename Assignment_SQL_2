Read the following data set:

https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.data

Task:

1. Create an sqlalchemy engine using a sample from the data set

Solution:

import sqlalchemy
import pandas as pd
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

df = pd.read_csv('https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.data',sep=",",header=None)
df.columns=['age','workclass','fnlwgt','education','educationNum','marital-status','occupation','relationship','race','sex','capital-gain','capital-loss','hours-per-week','native-country','income']
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///myData.db')
df.to_sql('alchemynew', engine)

2. Write two basic update queries

Solution:

a)

print(engine.execute('''UPDATE alchemynew
SET income = '<30K'
WHERE age=39 and workclass=' State-gov' and fnlwgt=77516
and education=' Bachelors' and educationNum=13'''))

print(engine.execute('''SELECT * FROM alchemynew
WHERE age=39 and workclass=' State-gov' and fnlwgt=77516
and education=' Bachelors' and educationNum=13 ''').fetchall())

b)

print(engine.execute('''UPDATE alchemynew
SET income = '<30K'
WHERE age=38 and workclass=' Private' and fnlwgt=215646
and education=' HS-grad' and educationNum=9'''))

print(engine.execute('''SELECT * FROM alchemynew
WHERE age=38 and workclass=' Private' and fnlwgt=215646
and education=' HS-grad' and educationNum=9''').fetchall())

3. Write two delete queries

Solution:

a)

print(engine.execute('''DELETE FROM alchemynew
WHERE age=39 and workclass=' State-gov' and fnlwgt=77516
and education=' Bachelors' and educationNum=13'''))

print(engine.execute('''SELECT * FROM alchemynew
WHERE age=39 and workclass=' State-gov' and fnlwgt=77516
and education=' Bachelors' and educationNum=13 ''').fetchall())

b)

print(engine.execute('''DELETE FROM alchemynew
WHERE age=38 and workclass=' Private' and fnlwgt=215646
and education=' HS-grad' and educationNum=9'''))

print(engine.execute('''SELECT * FROM alchemynew
WHERE age=38 and workclass=' Private' and fnlwgt=215646
and education=' HS-grad' and educationNum=9''').fetchall())

4. Write two filter queries

Solution:

a)

print(engine.execute('''SELECT * FROM alchemynew WHERE race LIKE ' W%' limit 10''').fetchall())

b)

print(engine.execute('''SELECT * FROM alchemynew WHERE age  IN(30, 40) limit 10''').fetchall())

5. Write two function queries

Solution:

a)

print(engine.execute('''SELECT * FROM alchemynew WHERE LENGTH(workclass)==8 limit 10''').fetchall())

b)

print(engine.execute('''SELECT sex,upper(sex) FROM alchemynew limit 10''').fetchall())
